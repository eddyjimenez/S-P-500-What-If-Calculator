# S-P-500-What-If-Calculator
This is a program that takes the starting year, ending year, and initial investment as user input.
Then it shows you how much you would have made, had you invested that lump sum of money in that year.

No arguments needed, just run using:
python "S&P500_LumpSum_WhatIf_Calculator.py"
